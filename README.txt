This is a bit of homework I did during the hiring process at Dark Horse. I put
it in source control so that a) I could prove I know how git works and b) so you
could step through the commits and see how this assignment evolved.

I explained my thought process and decision making in the PROCESS file which is
available as a simple ORG mode document or an exported HTML file. I tried to
make my process as clear as possible to highlight various decision points I made
along the way. Many thanks to @gongzhitaao on GitHub for his org-css project,
the exported html is fairly beautiful thanks to them.

Not knowing for sure at the time to what extent I was expected to work on this
assignment, I opted for an approach that aims primarily for correction and
simplification at first, and then moved towards prioritizing the ability to
extend and maintain the code easily, without making too many assumptions about
what might be necessary in the future. That way I could stop a certain points
and say "I could stop here if this was just a throwaway script, but if this was
in a larger application context I might...", and so on.
